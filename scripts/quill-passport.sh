# Quill Change Control - GitHub Action wrapper.
#
# Runs `quill verify`, turns the Change Passport into a PR-visible summary +
# commit Status Check, exposes the verdict as a step output, and exits 0 for
# PASS / NEEDS_REVIEW or 1 for BLOCK so the job gates the merge.
#
# Fail-closed design (security re-review P0-3): the verdict is read ONLY from a
# passport this run wrote into a fresh temp dir, never from the repo working
# tree, so a passport committed into the PR (or left over from a prior step)
# can never be mistaken for a real verdict. Any unexpected verifier exit, a
# missing/malformed passport, an unrecognised verdict, or (when a gate public
# key is configured) a passport whose signature does not verify, all fail the
# job rather than letting the merge through.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   QUILL_HEAD          ref to verify against the contract base (default HEAD)
#   QUILL_PASSPORT_DIR  where the published passport.{json,md} are copied
#                       (default .quill); the verdict is NOT trusted from here
#   QUILL_STRICT        "true" (default) requires a signed perimeter + contract
#   QUILL_FAIL_ON_BLOCK "true" to exit 1 on BLOCK (default true)
#   QUILL_GATE_PUBKEYS  trusted gate PUBLIC key(s) (PEM/paths). When set, the
#                       passport signature MUST verify or the job fails closed.
#   QUILL_HEAD_SHA      commit SHA to attach the Status Check to (default: git HEAD)
#   GITHUB_TOKEN        token for the Status Check + PR comment (optional)
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY   owner/repo (provided by Actions)
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT       step-output file (provided by Actions)
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY job-summary file (provided by Actions)
