"""Readiness: tell the human, in one glance, whether the gate is a *real* boundary.

The trap this guards against is the one that matters most: a key sitting in a
file on the same laptop the agent runs on is NOT off the agent's reach — the
agent runs as you and can read it. So readiness never reports "secure" just
because a key file exists. A control only counts as an enforced boundary when
its trust root lives where the agent cannot go:

  * the CI runner (a different machine) — secrets the laptop agent can't read, or
  * a hardware key (YubiKey / HSM / Secure Enclave) — un-exportable even to root.

This module computes a posture — ``enforced`` / ``cooperative`` / ``unconfigured``
— from what it can actually observe, and says exactly what's missing. It is the
"do the thinking for them" surface: run it and you know if you can stop worrying.
