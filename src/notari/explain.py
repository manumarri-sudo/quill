"""Deterministic remediation layer over a Change Passport.

Turns passport.json findings into three-part remediation records a
non-technical reader can act on: what's wrong in plain English, a concrete
self-fix (with a literal shell command where one applies), and a paste-ready
instruction for the coding agent. Pure rendering over existing evidence —
no model anywhere, same as the verdict itself.

The `plain` field must never use gate jargon (perimeter, provenance, MAC,
