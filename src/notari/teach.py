"""Write promoted Notari lessons into agent instruction files, and render the
compact fix-prompt / agent-brief surfaces.

Managed-block contract: everything between the notari-lessons markers belongs
to Notari; everything outside is the user's and is never touched. Updates are
idempotent — re-running with the same lessons is a byte-for-byte no-op.

Token discipline: agents get compressed briefs and fix prompts, never the
full passport (that stays for humans and auditors).
