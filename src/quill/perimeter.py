"""The standing perimeter: sign the boundary once, enforce it on every PR.

A human should not have to approve every change an agent makes - especially not
across a fleet of a hundred agents. The perimeter is the answer: a human signs
*the boundary* one time (what agents may touch, what they may never touch, that
secrets are always blocked), and from then on every pull request from every
agent is checked against that signed boundary automatically. A human is paged
only when a change crosses the line, never on routine in-bounds work.

The perimeter lives at ``<repo>/.quill/perimeter.json`` and is signed via
``provenance`` into ``.quill/perimeter.sig``. Because the signature covers the
exact perimeter content, an agent cannot widen ``allowed_paths`` or delete a
``forbidden_paths`` entry without invalidating it - and only the human approver's
off-box private key can re-sign.

# The per-task contract (.quill/contract.json / .sig) is deliberately NOT here:
# its commit legitimately lands inside the base..head range, so gate-tamper would
# always fire on it. Its integrity is protected by its SIGNATURE instead - the
# contract supplies the base commit and scope, so `verify --strict` requires it
# to be signed by a trusted approver (security review P0-1), which is what makes
# a PR-rewritten or forged contract fail (the signature no longer matches).
