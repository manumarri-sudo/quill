"""Touch ID gating for `quill approve`.

The default approve flow is: user types `quill approve <token>`, the token
gets persisted, and the agent's next call is allowed. A compromised terminal
or a hijacked agent can self-approve by typing the token. This module adds
hardware-rooted liveness - Touch ID - so the approval requires a fingerprint
match against the user's enrolled biometrics. The match is performed in the
Secure Enclave; userspace gets only a yes/no and never sees the biometric.

macOS only. On Linux/Windows, on SSH sessions, on Macs without Touch ID
hardware enrolled, `is_available()` returns False and the caller falls
through to today's typed-token-only flow with an `approve.biometric.skipped`
audit event.

Critical security note: we use `LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics`
NOT `LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthentication`. The latter falls back to the user's
login password - which a keylogger captures, defeating the whole point.
DO NOT change the policy constant without reading SECURITY.md.

Verified live on Apple Silicon macOS (2026-05-08). The threading.Event +
reply-block pattern fires without requiring a separate NSRunLoop pump.
