"""Quill Lessons: turn blocked AI PRs into lessons future agents learn from.

Every BLOCK / NEEDS_REVIEW verdict is converted into small structured
mistake events (never code, diffs, prompts, or secret values), stored
locally in ``.quill/mistakes.jsonl``. Repeated patterns aggregate into
deterministic suggested lessons a human can promote into agent
instruction files (see teach.py). Nothing here influences the verdict:
this module runs post-decision, mirrors learning.py's non-negotiables
(tightening guidance may be suggested; nothing auto-applies without a
human command), and never sends anything off-machine.
