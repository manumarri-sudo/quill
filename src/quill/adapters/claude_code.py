"""Claude Code PreToolUse hook adapter.

Claude Code's built-in tools (Bash, Edit, Write, Read, ...) do not flow
through any MCP server, so the Quill MCP proxy cannot see them. Claude Code
exposes a `PreToolUse` hook that fires synchronously before each tool call;
this adapter implements that hook contract so Quill can gate the built-ins.

Wiring (one paste into ~/.claude/settings.json):

    {
      "hooks": {
        "PreToolUse": [
          {
            "matcher": "Bash|Edit|Write|NotebookEdit",
            "hooks": [
              { "type": "command", "command": "quill claude-hook", "timeout": 10 }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

The hook contract (Claude Code → stdin):

    {
      "session_id": "uuid",
      "transcript_path": "/path/to/session.jsonl",
      "cwd": "/current/dir",
      "permission_mode": "auto|plan|acceptEdits|dontAsk|default",
      "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
      "tool_name": "Bash",
      "tool_input": {"command": "rm -rf /"}
    }

The hook reply (stdout, exit 0):

    {
      "hookSpecificOutput": {
        "permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask",
        "permissionDecisionReason": "<plain English>"
      }
    }

Mapping rules (defaults; per-tool overrides loaded from ~/.quill/config.toml):
    LOW      -> "allow"     (silent; logged)
    MEDIUM   -> "allow"     (silent; logged)
    HIGH     -> "ask"       (delegate confirmation to Claude Code's UI; logged)
    CRITICAL -> "deny"      (with plain-English reason; logged)

Every invocation appends an entry to the audit log regardless of decision,
so you can review what the agent attempted even when Claude Code's UI moved
on. The audit log path defaults to ~/.quill/audit.log.jsonl; override with
QUILL_LOG.

    Wired to `quill claude-hook` via the CLI module. Routes the audit

    per-project mode. ALSO lazily ensures the watch dashboard daemon is
    alive so users never need to re-type `quill watch` after a reboot.

    Order of operations is load-bearing:
      1. Read stdin + resolve the per-project log path.
      2. PAUSE CHECK - if the operator ran `quill off`, let the call
         through (logged with gate_paused) and return BEFORE self_test.
         This is deliberate: pause must work as a recovery hatch even when
         the classifier is broken (the exact lockout that motivated it).
      3. self_test() - only on the gated path. If it fails, fail closed.
      4. run_hook() - normal classification.
