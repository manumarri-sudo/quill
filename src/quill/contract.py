"""Change contract: the human-approved task, captured at `quill begin`.

A contract is the anchor of Quill Change Control. Before an agent writes code,
a human records WHAT was approved (the task), WHERE it may touch (allowed
paths), and the base commit the work starts from. `quill verify` later compares
`git diff <base_commit> HEAD` against this record, so the contract is the fixed
point the whole verdict is measured against.

The file lives at ``<repo-root>/.quill/contract.json`` and is intentionally
plain JSON - it is committed nowhere by Quill itself, reviewable by a human, and
small enough to paste into a PR. Creation is audit-chained (``contract.created``)
so a Change Passport can cite a tamper-evident record of when the task was
approved and against which base commit.
