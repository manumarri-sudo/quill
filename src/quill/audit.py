"""Append-only signed audit log.

Format: JSONL, one event per line. Every event includes:
  - ts            ISO-8601 timestamp UTC
  - session_id    parent or current session
  - agent_id      which sub-agent in the delegation tree (root if absent)
  - prev_mac      HMAC of the previous entry (the chain anchor)
  - payload       event-specific fields
  - mac           HMAC-SHA256 of (prev_mac || canonical(payload)) under the
                  per-installation HMAC key

Tamper-evidence: any modification or insertion breaks the chain at the next
verify. Use `quill audit verify <logfile>` to validate.

Performance: writes use O_APPEND for atomicity, fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX) for
cross-process serialization of the read-tail+append sequence (each emit
re-reads the tail mac under the lock so the chain stays intact when many
hook subprocesses fire concurrently). fsync is BATCHED by default (every
N entries or M ms, whichever first), with FORCE-fsync on any entry whose
risk >= HIGH so a power loss never drops a critical-risk row.
