"""GitHub PR-review provenance: the human clicks Approve, the agent can't.

The signed perimeter (``perimeter`` + ``provenance``) is one root of trust. This
is the other, for teams who'd rather use GitHub's own review system than manage
keys: require that a *human who is not the PR author* has submitted an APPROVED
review **on the current head commit**. An agent opening a PR with its own token
cannot approve its own PR, and an approval is dismissed the moment a new commit
is pushed - so this can't be replayed against code the human never saw.

The decision is a pure function over the reviews list (``evaluate_approval``),
so it is fully testable without the network. ``fetch_reviews`` is the only part
that talks to GitHub, via the stdlib (no new dependency), and is injected so
tests never hit the wire. This lives OUTSIDE ``verify`` on purpose: ``verify``
is deterministic and network-free, and the Action calls this check alongside it.
