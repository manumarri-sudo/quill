"""Regression tests for the Tier-1 obfuscation fixes from the 2026-06-12 audit.

Tier-0 (test_audit_fixes_tier1's sibling) closed the literal-form bypasses the
first audit found. Tier-1 closes the next layer of *cheap, well-known shell
obfuscations* that an empirical red-team probe showed still slipped through as
MEDIUM (i.e. auto-allowable). Each test names the concrete shape it closes.

These are defense-in-depth, NOT a hard boundary. The threat model
(docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md, limit 1) is explicit that semantic shell obfuscation
is unbounded and a complete fix needs a shell AST / syscall view, not more
regex. The `test_residual_*` cases at the bottom are xfail-marked: they are the
shapes we knowingly do NOT close, kept visible so the honest gap stays on the
record (and so a future AST-layer fix flips them to XPASS).

Probe that produced these: a battery of evasions run through the real
classify_command; 7 of 9 slips closed by these fixes, 2 left as residual.
