"""Step C test: replay-against-real-log integration.

Feed every learning-signal event from the user's actual
~/.notari/audit.log.jsonl through post_decision_update, then assert
the resulting pattern_stats match a hand-derived expectation.

This is the test the rc5 honest audit was missing - end-to-end
exercise of the learning loop against the same data shape the
production gate produces. If this test passes, the learner's
state-derivation is sound against the real distribution.

The test is gated on the real log being present; skipped otherwise.
