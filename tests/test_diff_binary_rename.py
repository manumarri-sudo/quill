"""Binary files and renames must not slip past the diff inventory (re-review P0-4).

`git diff` (without --binary) renders a changed binary as a one-line
``Binary files a/x and b/y differ`` stanza with NO ``---``/``+++`` lines, and a
rename as ``rename from``/``rename to`` with no hunks. The earlier parser keyed
off ``---``/``+++`` only, so a binary blob written anywhere was invisible to both
the scope check and the gate-tamper surfaces, and a rename was scope-checked on
the new path alone. These tests pin the closed behavior using the exact text
real git emits.
