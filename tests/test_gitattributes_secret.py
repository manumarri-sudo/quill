"""A .gitattributes -diff entry must not suppress secret detection (review H-2).

`secret.txt -diff` makes git render the file as `Binary files ... differ`, hiding
its added lines from a diff-text scanner. verify() now scans with `git diff
--text`, which overrides the attribute, so the secret is still caught.
