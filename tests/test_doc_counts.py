"""Single-source-of-truth guard for the headline numbers in public docs.

A security tool whose whole pitch is "don't trust me, read the regexes" loses
all credibility the moment a reader greps and finds the count is wrong. These
tests pin the one number the README states about the code (the vendor secret
pattern count) so prose and implementation can never silently drift apart
(audit #5/#31/#44). The audit-entry and test counts are intentionally phrased
durably in the docs ("32k+", "1030") and are not asserted here, since they
move every run and a brittle assertion would be worse than the drift.
