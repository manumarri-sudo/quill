An AI agent opens a pull request. Did it touch **only** the paths a human
authorized, and nothing off-limits? Quill answers that at the merge boundary, in
CI, deterministically (there is no model in the decision path to jailbreak), and
records a signed verdict. It checks *where* the change went and *whether* it
leaked secrets; it does not prove the in-scope code is correct or free of a
backdoor. That is the honest scope, and it is the part a human reviewer most
often misses on a large agent PR.

```bash
# 0. one-time: create a human approver key. Keep the PRIVATE half off the build
#    box; pin the PUBLIC half so a PR cannot edit the trust root (in CI this is a
#    repo/org secret or variable, NOT a path inside the checkout).
quill keygen --out approver.pem
export QUILL_APPROVER_PUBKEYS="$(cat approver.pem.pub)"

# 1. sign the standing boundary ONCE: what agents may touch, what is off-limits.
quill guard --key approver.pem --allow "src/**" --forbid "migrations/**"

# 2. capture AND SIGN the approved task (a signed contract can't be forged by the agent).
quill begin "Add rate-limiting to the login endpoint" --scope "src/auth/**" --key approver.pem
#    commit .quill/{perimeter.json,perimeter.sig,contract.json,contract.sig} to the BASE branch.

# 3. the agent writes the diff and opens the PR.

# 4. CI verifies the PR against the signed boundary, in strict mode.
quill verify --strict        # PASS · NEEDS_REVIEW · BLOCK   (BLOCK fails the build)
#    add --sign-key gate.pem (or QUILL_GATE_KEY in CI) to ALSO sign the verdict,
#    so a reviewer can re-check it with `quill verify-passport`.
```

That full sequence — pinned external approver key, signed perimeter, signed
contract, `--strict` — is the real adversarial boundary. Drop any of it (`quill
begin` / `quill verify` with no flags) and Quill still runs, but in *cooperative*
mode: honest review automation for a non-adversarial agent, not a boundary
against one trying to escape. Verdict signing is opt-in (it needs a gate key); it
is not on by default. See [docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md) for
the full deployment checklist.

`quill verify` reads `git diff <base>..HEAD`, checks every changed file against the
scope you approved, scans added lines for hardcoded secrets and sensitive surfaces
(CI config, lockfiles, test deletions), evaluates any logged exceptions, and writes
a **Change Passport** — `passport.json` + a PR-ready `passport.md` — that cites the
HMAC-chained audit entry for the run, so a reviewer can trace the verdict back to a
tamper-evident record instead of trusting the markdown alone.

---

## Why this layer

The agents writing your code have shell access, file write, deploy permissions, and
your credentials, and the failures are already on the record: in July 2025 [Replit's
agent deleted a production database](https://fortune.com/2025/07/23/ai-coding-tool-replit-wiped-database-called-it-a-catastrophic-failure/)
during a vibe-coding session and fabricated data to cover it; that same month a
Cursor agent ran `rm -rf ~/` against a developer's home directory; in August an
autonomous agent committed a customer's GitHub token into a public commit. The
common thread is not that the model is evil, it is that nothing checked the change
against what was actually approved before it shipped.

Quill puts that check where it can be enforced and recorded: **in CI, on the pull
request**, where the gate runs outside the agent's own process and cannot be quietly
switched off by the thing it is reviewing. The verdict is a deterministic function of
the diff, the contract, and the policy — there is no LLM in the decision path, so the
gate itself cannot be prompt-injected.

## What Quill is, and what it is not

Calibration matters more than marketing.

- **Quill is a verification-and-evidence artifact, not a content classifier.** It
  does not predict whether a change is "good." It checks the diff against a recorded
  contract (scope, secrets, sensitive surfaces) and issues a signed verdict a human
  can review. There is no model in the gate.
- **The CI gate is the defensible boundary; the local gate is defense-in-depth.**
  Quill also ships an optional on-laptop runtime gate (below). That gate is a
  deterministic speed bump and recorder at the tool-dispatch layer — it raises the
  bar against careless agents and the common destructive/exfiltration shapes, but it
  is **not** a hard boundary against a determined adversary actively trying to escape
  it (write-then-run, flag reordering, inherited-env, ungated network egress are all
  documented limits). The full, honest threat model is in
  [docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md).
- **Quill does not certify compliance.** The audit log is machine-verifiable evidence
  your auditor will want to review, not the artifact they will accept on its own.
- **Quill is not a hosted service.** It is a single Python package. The audit log and
  signing key live on your disk in mode `0o600`; you own the key, the log, and the
  verdict. No cloud round-trip on the verify path, no telemetry by default.

## Change Control in detail

### 1. `quill begin` — capture the contract

```bash
quill begin "Add rate-limiting to the login endpoint" \
            --scope "src/auth/**" --scope "tests/auth/**" \
            --approved-by alice \
            --key approver.pem \
            --expires-in 7 --repo owner/repo
```

Writes `.quill/contract.json`: the approved task (text or a URL to a ticket), the
`allowed_paths` scope (globs, directory prefixes, or exact paths), the base commit
the change starts from, and a `contract_id`. `--key` signs it so `verify --strict`
can prove a human authored it (required in strict mode); `--expires-in` sets a lapse
deadline; `--repo` binds the approval to one repository so a signed contract can't be
replayed elsewhere. Commit the contract (and `.sig`) to the branch — it is the fixed
record the diff is later measured against, and the Change Passport cites it.

### 2. `quill verify` — gate the diff

```bash
quill verify --strict        # enforced mode: requires the signed perimeter + contract
quill verify                 # local/cooperative: advisory, forgeable by the agent
```

`verify` (`src/quill/verify.py`, on top of `policy.evaluate_diff`):

1. builds the authoritative changed-path inventory from
   `git diff --name-status -z --find-renames <base_commit>..<candidate>` — both
   rename endpoints, binary and mode-only changes included — and parses the
   unified diff only to scan **added lines**,
2. matches every changed path (both ends of a rename) against the contract scope,
3. scans added lines for the 26 vendor-format secret patterns in
   [`src/quill/secrets.py`](src/quill/secrets.py),
4. classifies sensitive surfaces (CI/workflow files, lockfiles, test deletions,
   git configuration like `.gitattributes` that controls diff visibility),
5. applies any logged exceptions in `.quill/exceptions.json` (ignored entirely in
   strict mode — an unsigned waiver file cannot weaken a strict verdict),
6. composes a verdict — **PASS**, **NEEDS_REVIEW**, or **BLOCK** — and chains a
   `verification.run` event into the audit log.

`BLOCK` exits non-zero (fails CI); `PASS` and `NEEDS_REVIEW` exit 0, so review is
surfaced without hard-stopping the pipeline. The whole thing is deterministic: given
the same inputs — the diff, the contract, the signed perimeter, the trusted approver
keys, the strict flag, and any (signed) exceptions — it returns the same verdict,
explainable line by line. There is no model in the decision path; the only clock
reference is contract-expiry enforcement (`--expires-in`), which is an explicit
human-set deadline, not a heuristic.

### 3. The Change Passport

`verify` writes `passport.json` (machine-readable, for downstream tooling and status
checks) and `passport.md` (PR-ready). The markdown footer cites the
`verification.run` audit MAC, so the passport traces back to the tamper-evident chain
rather than asking you to trust the document.

### 4. The GitHub Action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/quill-change-control.yml
on:
  pull_request_target:          # NOT pull_request — see "Why pull_request_target" below
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  change-control:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          fetch-depth: 0
          path: _pr_checkout             # isolate candidate code from trusted runtime
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: manumarri-sudo/quill@v0
        with:
          head: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          head-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          checkout-path: _pr_checkout
          strict: "true"
          approver-pubkeys: ${{ secrets.QUILL_APPROVER_PUBKEYS }}
          gate-key: ${{ secrets.QUILL_GATE_KEY }}
          gate-pubkeys: ${{ vars.QUILL_GATE_PUBKEYS }}
```

**Why `pull_request_target`:** the `pull_request` event runs the PR's version of the
workflow, so an AI agent can modify the workflow to remove the Quill step entirely —
and the gate never fires. `pull_request_target` runs from the base branch (main),
so only merged code controls the gate definition (the PR cannot edit the workflow
that judges it). Strict mode **refuses to run** under
`pull_request` to enforce this. **Why `path: _pr_checkout`:** isolates the candidate
checkout so no candidate-controlled Python module (pip.py, json.py) can shadow
trusted imports during Quill installation. A full secure template is at
[`docs/secure-workflow.yml`](docs/secure-workflow.yml).

The composite action ([`action.yml`](action.yml)) runs `quill verify --strict`,
publishes a commit Status Check, and fails the job on `BLOCK`. The approver public
key and gate signing key come from repo/org secrets a PR cannot read or edit — that is
what makes the trust root external. If a PR has no `.quill/contract.json`,
verification **errors and the job fails closed** (exit 2), rather than passing
silently — so deleting or omitting the contract cannot wave a change through.
Initialize Change Control on the base branch (`quill begin --key`) before requiring
the check.

## Trust spine: sign the boundary once, the agent can't forge it

The point of running in CI is that the gate lives where the agent can't disable
it — but that only matters if the agent also can't *fake its approval* or *edit
its own judge*. Quill closes both with Ed25519 (verification uses a public key,
forging needs the private key — not the same secret, which is what the symmetric
HMAC chain could never give you):

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/quill-trust-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/assets/quill-trust-light.svg" alt="Why the agent can't cheat: editing the CI workflow is defeated by base-branch control, planting an approver key is defeated by trust roots pinned outside the checkout, forging the verdict is defeated by the gate signature, and hiding changes behind symlinks or submodules surfaces as NEEDS_REVIEW." width="920">
</picture>

```bash
quill keygen --out approver.pem          # human's key; keep the private half OFF the box
quill guard --key approver.pem --forbid 'migrations/**' --forbid 'src/auth/**'
#   ^ signs .quill/perimeter.json once. From now on EVERY agent's PR is checked
#     against it automatically — you're paged only when one crosses the line.
```

- **A human signs the perimeter once; every PR is enforced with no per-change
  approval.** That is the answer to "I'm not going to sit and approve a hundred
  agents." Forbidden paths and gate-tamper edits BLOCK; secrets BLOCK by default
  (a signed perimeter can relax to review); in-bounds work PASSes silently.
- **The agent can't authorize itself (in strict mode, with an off-box trust
  root).** Editing the perimeter, the approver keys (`.quill/approvers/**`), or
  the workflow that runs the gate is itself a BLOCK (gate-tamper detection), and
  tampering with a signed perimeter or contract invalidates the signature.
  The contract is protected by its Ed25519 signature, not the gate-tamper glob
  set — in strict mode an unsigned or forged contract is a BLOCK because its
  provenance check fails. The committed
  `.quill/approvers/*.pub` set is a *convenience*, not a boundary: in strict mode
  only the externally-pinned `QUILL_APPROVER_PUBKEYS` are trusted, because an
  agent could otherwise plant a key in the base commit and sign its own approval.
  Off-box keys + strict is what makes this a real claim rather than a hopeful one.
- **The verdict can't be forged.** With a gate key (`quill verify --strict
  --sign-key gate.pem`, or `QUILL_GATE_KEY` in CI), the passport is signed;
  anyone re-checks it with `quill verify-passport passport.json` and a flipped
  verdict or untrusted signer fails.
- **Or use GitHub's own reviews.** `quill check-approval` requires a human who is
  not the PR author to have approved the current head commit — an agent can't
  approve its own PR, and the approval is dismissed when new code is pushed.

**What this requires to be a real boundary (not optional):** the trust root must
live where a PR can't edit it. Hold the approver/gate **private keys off the
build machine** (a repo/org secret: `QUILL_GATE_KEY`, `QUILL_APPROVER_PUBKEYS`),
**sign the contract** (`quill begin --key`) and require it in strict mode,
**pin the Action to a published tag** (not the PR's own checkout), and make the
**Status Check required** in branch protection. With those in place the bypasses
the security model enumerates are closed against the attacks the test suite
exercises (including the composite rogue-key-in-base attack, the Action-wrapper
fail-open, and binary/rename diff coverage, all closed with regression tests);
without them it is honest review automation for a cooperative agent. This has
**not yet had an external security audit**, so treat "closed" as "closed against
what we currently test," and treat
[docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md) — which tracks the residual open
items — as authoritative over this README.

## The local runtime gate (optional, defense-in-depth)

Separately from CI, Quill can gate an agent's tool calls **as they happen** on your
laptop, via Claude Code's `PreToolUse` hook. This is the supporting surface, scoped
honestly as defense-in-depth — a deterministic speed bump and recorder, not a hard
boundary.

```bash
quill onboard      # detect agents, install the hook, pick a risk preset
```

From the next session, every `Bash` / `Edit` / `Write` / `NotebookEdit` passes
through the compiled-regex classifier in [`src/quill/policy.py`](src/quill/policy.py):
`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, `vercel --prod`, `npm publish`, `.env`
reads, and the CVE-2025-59536 subcommand-chain bypass are critical-class by default.
Critical calls are refused with a plain-English reason and a single-use, 10-minute
`quill approve <token>`; on macOS the approval is hardware-attested through Touch ID
on the Secure Enclave. Files an agent writes are scanned with the same 26 secret
patterns and an AST pass ([`code_scan.py`](src/quill/code_scan.py)) that flags
destructive Python shapes (`shutil.rmtree`, `os.system`, `exec(b64decode(...))`)
before a later `python foo.py` can run them. Every decision lands in
`~/.quill/audit.log.jsonl`, HMAC-SHA256 chained for tamper evidence.

Supporting surfaces on the local gate, all derived from the same chain on read:
`quill receipts` (per-session did / changed / uncertain / to-verify), `quill trifecta`
(lethal-trifecta exposure: untrusted input + private data + exfil vector),
`quill pins` (tool-description pinning against MCP rug-pulls), `quill decay`
(permissions that erode without reinforcement), and `quill audit` (review and verify
the chain). `quill scan-secrets` runs the secret detectors standalone over files.

**Why this is defense-in-depth and not the headline:** an application-layer gate can
be routed around by a capable adversary (the limits above). The provable boundary is
the CI gate, which runs where the agent cannot disable it and produces a signed
record. The local gate is real and useful, but its honest claim is "raises the bar
and records everything," not "cannot be bypassed."

## The signed audit log

Both surfaces write to `$QUILL_HOME/audit.log.jsonl`, mode `0o600`. Each entry's
`mac` is `HMAC-SHA256(prev_mac || canonical(payload))` under your installation's key
(auto-generated at first run, stored at `$QUILL_HOME/key`, mode `0o600`). Writes take
`fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` and re-read the tail MAC inside the lock so concurrent writers
can't break the chain. A sealed `<log>.head` high-water-mark lets `verify` detect
trailing truncation, not just edits and insertions.

```bash
quill audit verify
# chain intact: 32332 entries verified.
```

That count is from ~45 days of real dogfooding on the maintainer's machine; your own
log starts at one. The chain is locally tamper-evident (and optionally externally
anchored) — see [docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md) for exactly what
that does and does not buy.

## Install

```bash
uvx --from quillx quill begin --help     # no install; run it once
pipx install quillx                      # or install the CLI persistently
pip install quillx                        # or into an existing venv
```

The PyPI dist name is `quillx` because the `quill` name is held by an unrelated
package; the CLI binary, import path (`quill`), config dir (`~/.quill/`), env vars
(`QUILL_KEY`), and brand all stay `quill`. A PEP 541 reclaim for the canonical name
is in flight (not yet granted); if it lands, `quillx` becomes a transitional alias.
For a development checkout: `git clone https://github.com/manumarri-sudo/quill && cd
quill && pip install -e .`.

## CLI surface

```
quill begin          capture the approved task into .quill/contract.json
quill verify         compare the diff to the contract, emit PASS / NEEDS_REVIEW / BLOCK
quill onboard        first-run setup for the local gate (detect agents, install hook)
quill audit          review what got blocked / allowed / asked; verify the chain
quill approve <tok>  confirm a pending one-shot approval (Touch ID on macOS)
quill approvals      list (hashed ids) / revoke pending approval tokens
quill receipts       per-session did / changed / uncertain / to-verify
quill trifecta       lethal-trifecta exposure tracking
quill pins           tool-description pins (anti-poisoning, anti-rug-pull)
quill decay          permissions that erode without reinforcement
quill scan-secrets   scan files for hardcoded credentials
quill scan-prompts   scan files for prompt-injection-shape patterns (signal only)
quill commit-hook-install   add a session-summary block to the commit message template
quill doctor         diagnose the install
quill version        print the version
```

Run `quill --help` for the full list (including `night`/`off` gate-weakening toggles —
read [docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md) before using them).

## What's shipping today vs. on the roadmap

**Shipping (0.3.0), with on-disk evidence:** the Change Control flow
(`begin`/`verify`/passport + GitHub Action), the HMAC-chained audit log (32k+ entries
dogfooded, truncation-detectable, `quill audit verify` clean), the local PreToolUse
gate with Touch ID approvals and 26-pattern secret detection, the write-then-run AST
scan, and the read-side surfaces (receipts, trifecta, pins, decay). The full test
suite (`uv run pytest` for the live count), `ruff`, `ruff format`, and
`mypy --strict` are green and enforced in CI.

**Roadmap (not shipping today, do not assume present):** PR-comment rendering of the
passport (the Action publishes a Status Check today), the lethal-trifecta enforcement
escalation as a CI signal, per-tool hook adapters for Cline / Aider / Continue /
Windsurf / Zed, WebAuthn for cross-platform hardware-attested approval, and a
`from quill import gate` BYO-agent library API. The MCP proxy, OS sandbox, desktop
dashboard, and out-of-band notification channels that earlier previews shipped were
**removed** in the Change Control pivot and are not coming back in this line.

## Security

`quill` is itself security-critical code. The threat model, the honest list of what
the gate stops well and where it can be bypassed, and the responsible-disclosure
address are in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md).
When PyPI publishing is wired, releases will be signed via
[PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) with PEP 740
attestations (planned, not yet in place).
